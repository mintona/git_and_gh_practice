In 2018, my husband and I took a trip to Thailand. We were there for 2 weeks.
We decided to stay in the Krabi area so we could be fully immersed instead of traveling around the country.
We stayed on an island called Koh Yao Yai where we rented a mo-ped and scooted our way around the island.
We then went to Railay Beach and then Ao Nang where we climbed on Tonsai Beach most days. This is also where we experienced character building food poisoning.
10/10 would recommend going to Thailand.
